# Predicting Airbnb Booking Rates: A Machine Learning Approach  

### Overview  
This repository contains a comprehensive project focused on predicting high booking rates for Airbnb listings using advanced machine learning techniques. By leveraging historical data and feature engineering, the project aims to provide actionable insights for Airbnb hosts, guests, and stakeholders to optimize performance and decision-making.  

### Objectives
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model to predict the booking rates of Airbnb listings. This predictive model aims to help:

- **Hosts** optimize their listings to increase revenue and occupancy.
- **Guests** find listings with high availability and quality.
- **Airbnb** improve recommendations and customer satisfaction.

### Methodology
- **Data Preparation:**
  - Cleaning missing values and encoding categorical variables.
  - Creating new features to enhance model performance (e.g., property type categorization, amenities count).

- **Feature Engineering:**
  - Key features were selected from the dataset, such as room type, price, and host attributes.
  - Text data was processed using one-hot encoding and counts to extract meaningful insights.

- **Model Development:**
  - Random Forest was selected as the final model due to its superior performance in handling complex, nonlinear relationships.
  - Multiple hyperparameters were tuned to balance model accuracy and generalizability.

- **Evaluation:**
  - Training data was split into training and validation sets.
  - The model's performance was evaluated using metrics like AUC (Area Under the Curve).

### Findings
- **Key Drivers:** Factors like pricing, room type, and amenities significantly impact booking rates.
- **Model Performance:** The final Random Forest model achieved high accuracy on training data but required further tuning to reduce overfitting.

### Conclusion
The developed model effectively predicts booking rates and offers actionable insights for Airbnb hosts to improve their listing strategies. While overfitting was a challenge, additional techniques like regularization can be explored in the future to enhance generalization.
